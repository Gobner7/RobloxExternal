# Roblox External

A simple, proof of concept Roblox External using Read/WriteProcessMemory on the Roblox game. This project has been made
with the purposes of learning reverse engineering and game hacking. At any point has this project been used to provoke
ill on other players (No cheats have been completed, nor is it on a working state)

### What?

This is a project that I wrote as a Proof of Concept for Rune. It was never finished due to it being leaked, and in the
end, continuing it becoming fruitless, as the source code was open for everyone.

### Does it work?

Short answer, No. Long answer, maybe. You only have to fix the GetChildren() function implementation with proper offsets
to obtain the LocalPlayer backpack.

### Can I base or use it?

Yes. You can use it as a base, with proper credits, as I wrote 99% of this code with zero pay.

### Contributor List

- Nano (Minimal)
- Stiven (Part of Rune CE team, helped with offsets, which in any case I still had to figure out and fix the C++ code)
- stable (Emotional Support)
